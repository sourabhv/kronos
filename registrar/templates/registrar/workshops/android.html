                <p>Oh! The Windows guys. 'WE' highly recommend you to switch to Linux based OSes, trust us it'll boost your productivity massively.</p>

                <p>Anyway, The first website you need to head to begin programming Android applications is the official <a href="http://developer.android.com/">Android</a> website.  Go on explore!</p>

                <p>You'll find a <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/index.html">Training</a> section under 'Develop'.  This should be your new home now.</p>

                <p>Phew! Now that you know about that, lets quickly head over to <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Developement Tools</a> page and install the latest build for <a href="https://dl.google.com/android/studio/install/0.8.6/android-studio-bundle-135.1339820-windows.exe">'Windows'</a>.
                Note: The file is quite large approx 380MB. So just wait for
                the awesomeness to begin. :)</p>
                <p class="terminator">. . .</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="noscript">Linux</h2>

                <p>You guys are incredible if you work on Linux machines. Hi-5 on that already.</p>
                <p>Since you are on an incredible machine you don't you figure out how to install yourself? Just grab the <a href="https://dl.google.com/android/studio/install/0.8.6/android-studio-bundle-135.1339820-linux.tgz">latest build file</a> from <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">here</a>.</p>

                <p>For the newbies, welcome and please learn how to do this process since you'll be doing it often in your life. Your downloaded file should look like this <code>Android-Studio-Bundle-135.1245622-linux.tgz</code>. Now simply do the following(make sure you're in the correct directory):</p>
                <ul class="code terminal">
                    <li>$ man tar #read about tarball extractions</li>
                    <li>$ mkdir ~/bin/</li>
                    <li>$ mv Android-Studio-Bundle-135.1245622-linux.tgz ~/bin/</li>
                    <li>$ cd ~/bin/</li>
                    <li>$ tar zxvf Android-Studio-Bundle-135.1245622-linux.tgz</li>
                    <li>#this might take a while.</li>
                    <li>$ cd android-studio</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Now this android-studio folder is where all the files are.
                To run android-studio from your terminal. We need to do 2
                things: 1) make it visible in our path 2) create symbolic link
                in /usr/bin to it</p>
                <ul class="code terminal">
                    <li>$ PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/android-studio/bin/studio.sh</li>
                    <li>$ sudo ln -s ~/bin/android-studio/bin/studio.sh /usr/bin/studio</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And that's it! Don't you feel like a hacker already? :)</p>
                <p class="terminator">. . .</p>
            </div>

    <p>Now that you're done, its time to make a github account. Go to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and sign up.</p>
    <p>That's it. Good work. We're proud of you!</p>
